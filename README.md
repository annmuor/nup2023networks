## NUP23 Computer Networks course

This repository will have homework stabs and different materials for my students.

## Curriculum

### How the Internet works

Autonomous Systems, RIPE/ARIN, BGP, Tier 1/2/3 ISP, peering explained

### Unicast/Broadcat/Multicast/Anycast

*Cast traffic types were explained. Unicast, broadcast and multicast traffic were captured and created using wireshark
tool and libpcap/PF_PACKET programming.

### HTTP protocol

HTTP 1 protocol, with practical tasks with hand-craftet requests. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols explained

### DNS Protocol

DNS protocol expoained, with practicals tasks on both running DNS client (resolver) and DNS server (authoritative)

### TCP protocol

TCP protocol explained, including TCP low-level socket programming and handcrafting TCP handshake with libpcap/PF_PACKET

### UDP protocol

UDP protocol explained, including UDP low-level socket programming

### IPv4 protocol

IPv4 protocol explained, including IPv4 low-level socket programming with libpcap/PF_PACKET

### IPv6 protocol

IPv6 protocol explained, including IPv6 tunnels practical tasks and IPv6-related task during the exam

### 802.1 + Ethernet II

802.1 and Ethernet II protocols explained with some practicals tasks with wireshark tool

### 802.11

802.11 Wireless protocol explained, including practical tasks with WEP and WPA security hijacking, using wireshark and
aircrack-ng tools on real captured wireless traffic

### Routing & Switching

Basic IP routing explained, NAT/PAT explained. Practical tasks were solved by some students. Cource project included
building ISP with IPv4 NAT and eBGP routing, all groups were able to complete the project.

### TLS/SSL

TLS/SSL layer explained. Practical tasks were given to work with TLS handshake manually and with PKI certificates,
including client certificate enrolling and authentication and SNI using openssl toolkit

### OSI/7 and TCP/IP models

Encapsulation layered models were explained

### VPN protocols

Different VPN protocols explained. Practical task to write ICMP VPN client were given and solved by at least 30% of the
group.

### P2P protocols

P2P protocol types were explained. Practical task to disable P2P "malware" botnet was given and was solved by at least
30% of the group.

### VOIP/Streaming protocols

H323, SIP, WebRTC protocols were explained

### Cellular networks

Cellular networking were explained without much details

### Networking security

Networking security were explained, some practical tasks were given in order to show vulnerabilites of the default
network configurations
